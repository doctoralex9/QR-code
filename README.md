Django QR Code Generator
This project is a web application built with Django that allows users to generate and display QR codes.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

Python 3.9+

Pip (Python package installer)

Git (for cloning the repository)

Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the project from the GitHub repository to your local machine.

git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <repository-folder-name>

Replace <your-repository-url> with the actual URL of your Git repository and <repository-folder-name> with the name of the project folder.

2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project-specific dependencies.

On Windows:

python -m venv env
.\env\Scripts\activate

On macOS/Linux:

python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate

3. Install Dependencies
Install all the required packages using the requirements.txt file. This single command will install Django, the MySQL connector, and all other necessary libraries.

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run Database Migrations
Apply the initial database migrations to set up your database schema.

python manage.py migrate

5. Run the Development Server
Start the Django development server.

python manage.py runserver

Accessing the Application
Once the server is running, open your web browser and navigate to the following URL:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/

You should now see the QR code generator application running.

Troubleshooting
Database Errors on Startup: If you see an error like ImproperlyConfigured: Error loading MySQLdb module, it means the database connector is missing. Run pip install -r requirements.txt again to install mysqlclient.

Unapplied Migrations: If you see a message about unapplied migrations, run python manage.py migrate before starting the server.
